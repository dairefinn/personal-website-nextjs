# Personal Website in Next.js

A recreation of [my personal website](https://github.com/dairefinn/dairefinn.github.io) using the Next.js framework and React.

This serves as a learning experience for me to familiarize myself with Next.js. I have previously used React and Expo in college projects and I recently created this same project using Vite so I thought it would be interesting to see how it compares to Next.js.

Most of this is the exact same as the Vite equivalent except for the routing and the environment variables usage.
